# i-Wardrobe
# a wardrobe which can detect the humidity and temperature inside it.
# it will activate the the fan when detected the temperature and humidity inside it exceeded the threshold
# a threshold which can turn clothes to yellow and getting mold
# 70% for humidity and 30C for temperature
# fan will be on after certain amount of time to prevent wastage on power consumption
# the loop for the system is one minutes
# the input the the temperature and humidity
# the output is the LCD display and the fan
# Arduino UNO is the microcontroller used
# DHT 11 is the sensor used to detect temperature and humidity
